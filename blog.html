        A Thread of Light: From Lawton Parker to Louis Ritman to Richard Zolan
       
      </h2>
      <h3>Link</h3>
      <p>
        When viewing the graceful brushwork and quiet intimacy in Richard Zolan’s portraits, one begins to sense something older beneath the surface — a lineage. 
        Louis Ritman, once a student of Lawton Parker and a master of the American Giverny school, painted with the same soft light and reverent stillness. 
        Zolan, decades later, seems to carry that spirit forward in his own way. While their names span different eras, the sensibility flows — elegant, introspective, 
        and human. For collectors today, it invites a fresh look: not just at Zolan’s appeal, but at the deeper artistic current he may be part of.

        Primitivism Without Paris: Grandma Moses and José Antonio Velásquez
       
      </h2>
      <h3>Link</h3>
      <p>
       While separated by continents, Grandma Moses and José Antonio Velásquez shared a rare artistic clarity — a self-taught vision rooted in memory, community, and place. 
        Both painted not to impress but to preserve, rendering villages, fields, and skies with a sincerity that defied academic norms.
        Their works offer no grand gestures, only the quiet persistence of daily life. In different corners of the world, these two primitivists arrived at a similar truth:
        that art can honor where you come from, even if the world isn’t watching.
